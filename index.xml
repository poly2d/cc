If Feljin or Ryu were to play the piano, what would they play, and what story would they tell?
That was my thought process going into this project. This piece is inspired by Awaiting Return by Kevin MacLeod, the background music our DM used at one point for the &amp;ldquo;BRB&amp;rdquo; screen (for IRL short rests) in the Phandelver campaign.
That piece itself is a derivative of the middle section of Jupiter, one of the movements from &amp;ldquo;The Planets&amp;rdquo; orchestral suite by Gustav Holst.</description>

Based on the Animenz arrangement: Video, Sheets.
I remember the first time I heard Animenz&amp;rsquo;s cover of this in 2015, the second chorus (~2:48) gave me goosebumps! It had been on my mind ever since to learn to play this someday.
The movie itself is pretty good IMO. It got a bit of attention back when it came out for using 3DCG, and also because it was screen-written by the one and only Urobucher.</description>

I basically grew up on Pokemon games. And if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I can tell you about the video game series, you will know when you&amp;rsquo;re about to against a formidable opponent. The music will let you know.
Hailing from &amp;ldquo;the land of piano&amp;rdquo;, Champion Cynthia is no exception. Leading an arsenal of powerful Pokemon that the player likely haven&amp;rsquo;t encountered up to that point, she descends to her throne as the final opponent at the Sinnoh League, ready to crush the player&amp;rsquo;s dreams.</description>

This was my second full arrangement cover! I haven&amp;rsquo;t turned it into sheets yet. Whether or not I end up doing that, piecing this together was a learning experience.
Before I get to anything else - yes the video is SHAKY AF. It&amp;rsquo;s really too bad. Watch it on a small screen - it&amp;rsquo;s not as noticeable üòÇ
Ever since I watched the original MV this song was on the bucket list.</description>

Based on the Animenz arrangement: Video, Sheets.
Another piece from Animenz&amp;rsquo;s Guilty Crown suite of covers, also from his earlier days. It&amp;rsquo;s in the same starting key as Bios but at a slower pace, 3&amp;frasl;4 signature, and a lot more room for expressiveness.
The middle section is the most interesting to play, requiring fast right hand runs in the upper registers, mixed in with occasional slowdown/speedups as an artifact of &amp;ldquo;squeezing in&amp;rdquo; few more notes into the measure.</description>

I love the lyrics of these 0048 songs! This one in particular is high energy and catchy, and I also kinda like its use of the &amp;ldquo;canon progression&amp;rdquo;.
This is one of the more difficult Animenz pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to date, and also one of the most fun to play! As usual, there is a story, and I&amp;rsquo;ve added a custom intro that marks a personal turning point, a new beginning, a departure&amp;hellip; and then dove right in:</description>

This cover is based on the scores by Cosmo Pianist. In general this was a good etude for dynamics and dissonant chords. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hold back when it came to expression - overlaying my emotions along with the somber world view that is &amp;lsquo;Neon Genesis Evangelion&amp;rsquo;.
I tapped into some of the heavy scenes from the work for inspiration; think - drowning, choking. Yeah that&amp;rsquo;s pretty fucked up imagery to draw on, but he just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shut the fuck up.</description>

Another shot at this song! This time with the new recording environment (and no pressure from live streaming üòÖ), and also with a new me having gone through some internal turmoil (see the rant posts before this lol).
Post from previous attempt
Outside of the recording quality, this take is arguably not so much better than my previous run, but there are several changes that I&amp;rsquo;d note as improvements.</description>

      <description>Continuing the ludicrous exploration which set off my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit the term attached. The definition is reproduced below:
 attached | 2 : emotionally connected : having strong feelings of affection or connection
 There&amp;rsquo;s an implication of a connection with emotion as the basis. What exactly does this mean? Maybe different things depending on the context and the individuals involved?
Before moving forwards, I&amp;rsquo;ll also reproduce below a previous snippet of my take on emotion and it&amp;rsquo;s relation to attraction:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure where to start for what I said in the previous post, but I figure I at the end of the day I want to understand what love is, so why not use the MW definitons of love as an entry point? Not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to understand in one day, but a north star would be helpful because I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get lost along the way.</description>

      <description>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
&amp;ndash; Henry David Thoreau, Walden
 
In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;ve been throwing out words like &amp;ldquo;romantic love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;emotional connection&amp;rdquo; without a clear understanding of them. As in, I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to clearly and concisely explain to someone what those words mean to me.</description>

      <description>Being polite is good, but being active is as important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t say anything, the things you want won&amp;rsquo;t appear right before you.
&amp;ndash; a wise friend
 Those were the words of my wise friend, who wrote to me years ago. You may remember that I shared them with you too. To this day, I still find myself scared to embrace those words. But there are also times when painfully I realize what he meant.</description>

      <description>I thought you understood, so I was a bit surprised to see you break the silence. That&amp;rsquo;s cheating.

I see your perspective though. Thoughts have an expiration date.
(And feelings have expirations too apparently&amp;hellip; as I learned the hard way. fml.)

Thanks for sharing.

      <description>As usual, the first thing that crosses my mind when I wake up is your name.
Is that disgusting?
What&amp;rsquo;s unusual is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been waking up way before the time I set on my alarm clock.
What&amp;rsquo;s unusual is that I just lay there for hours, trying to convince myself, you don&amp;rsquo;t really care about me.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t that disgusting?

As of this point, I still find the need to do this until I can get up again.</description>

      <description>Today I re-listened to the Radwimps song from Weathering with You.
The lyrics hurt more than ever.

 This is the courage that you gave me
So I want to use it for you
This is the love that you helped me grow
So it won&amp;rsquo;t mean anything if it&amp;rsquo;s not with you
Is there anything that love can still do?
Is there anything that I can still do?</description>

      <description>I can see where you are coming from. But there are some things I fail to understand completely.
If I had a partner, I&amp;rsquo;d want them to fulfill as much of my wants as possible. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;d do anything I can (within reason I guess) to help fulfill my partner&amp;rsquo;s wants? Like even if you know you can&amp;rsquo;t do so immediately, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you still want to and eventually try to reach a level that you can?</description>

      <description>Every time I reread your words, I increasingly realize that you&amp;rsquo;re on a different, much higher stratum than the one I am on.
They say you can&amp;rsquo;t buy love, but I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to think that maybe love is a bit like money?
You won&amp;rsquo;t spend it on others if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough yourself, right?

I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that I&amp;rsquo;m broke as fuck.</description>

      <description>Notes Based on the Animenz arrangement
 Video: https://youtu.be/P6C3szts5C4 Sheet: https://sheet.host/sheet/IGm7F5  This was a &amp;lsquo;high reach&amp;rsquo; piece for me in terms of difficulty. But it&amp;rsquo;s a special song and a cover had to be done.
The most difficult segments of the song are the chorus which feature fast left-hand jumps. Many retakes were done due to a lack of accuracy here.
While less obvious, &amp;ldquo;first verse&amp;rdquo; at 0:39 (measures 25-32) was also quite challenging.</description>

      <description>Notes First YouTube upload! The previous Periscopes were captured entirely on phone, but this was the first attempt at using an audio interface in search for better sound quality.
I mixed in elements from a few inspirations. Flowering Night from the Touhou series was used at 1:34 (a nod to Niconico covers) and a variation based on Lindsey Stirling&amp;rsquo;s cover at 1:47.
The &amp;ldquo;guitar riff&amp;rdquo; part of the song was skipped in favor of a more gentle bridge and reprise.</description>
