I thought you understood, so I was a bit surprised to see you break the silence. That's cheating.

<br/>


I see your perspective though. Thoughts have an expiration date.

(And feelings have expirations too apparently... as I learned the hard way. fml.)

Thanks for sharing.

My initial response was - wtf why are you doing this to me?

Stop making me even more sad, lmao.

I do like the chords and the voice.

But right now it's difficult for me to embrace it.

_I don't want to accept where I landed and where I'm heading and just dismiss it as "strange"._

_I don't want to accept... defeat...?_

... isn't that a weird label to use here? _Isn't that strange?_

Maybe that's my problem. Or, one of many.

<br/>


Lastly, it did give me some hope.

If strangers can become friends once, wouldn't they be able to a second time?

Maybe they can.

<br/>


If they can put the effort.
