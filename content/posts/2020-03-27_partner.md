I can see where you are coming from. But there are some things I fail to understand completely.

If I had a partner, I'd want them to fulfill as much of my wants as possible.
I feel like I'd do anything I can (within reason I guess) to help fulfill my partner's wants?
Like even if you know you can't do so immediately, wouldn't you still _want_ to and eventually try to reach a level that you can???

Are those thoughts unreasonable? Maybe my failure to understand is a reflection of how I lack a support network.
Perhaps I'd totally get it if I had access to a wide friendship pool to tap into for different needs and interests?

I don't think even best "friends" are going to stick around forever though. Perhaps it's a pessimistic viewpoint but I struggle to believe that people are willing to stick around. But a partner is supposed to be around forever (till u die) right?

What if they have to go? Can you just replace them?

What if I have to go? Can you replace me?

_Am I replaceable?_
