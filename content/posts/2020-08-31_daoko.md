This was my second full arrangement cover! I haven't turned it into sheets yet. Whether or not I end up doing that, piecing this together was a learning experience.

Before I get to anything else - yes the video is SHAKY AF. It's really too bad. Watch it on a small screen - it's not as noticeable 😂

Ever since I watched the [original MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tKVN2mAKRI) this song was on the bucket list. I haven't watched the movie but the way the MV is put together and the animation style just do it for me. I love you, Studio SHAFT.

In hindsight, the arrangement tries to do too much. I could have considered sticking closer to the original, or at least to something I can actually play because there's way too many mistakes.

This was the best take in the time I set aside, however. I've been putting an emphasis on output (as some say, deadlines are the only thing that move people), but is it even worth it if the quality drops?

Anyways, I'll try to rebalance output and quality accordingly, but at least for August, I made a deal w/ myself that I will do it by the end of the month, so this is what it is.

(Like turning in an incomplete assignment - better than getting no points. Learn from the L and move on to not slow down the next task. Been there done that 😅)

Alternatively, it'd be interesting to revisit the song again someday!

Composition highlights:

- Lyrics were again the _main driver_.

- This song borrows "three-hand technique" (3HT) patterns from the Animenz transcription of [虹の列車 / Niji no Ressha](/posts/2020-06-29_akb0048) on two occasions. Why that song? A nod to the "train" imagery.

 - The first verse at 0:22-0:41 is a 3HT with the melody supported by both hands, while each one also maintains it's own accompaniment. This is inspired by to Niji no Ressha measures 7-10.

 - Towards the end from 4:20-4:30 is a 3HT with left-based melody with scales on the right hand. This draws from the awesome ending of Niji no Ressha measures 41-end. I really struggled to balance the volume (the right overpowered again).

- Aside from the segment mentioned above, the first verse doesn't deviate too much from to the original. Grateful to the karaoke versions on Youtube.

- The second verse mixes things up a bit. 1:30-2:05 incorporate a mix of playfulness (deviations, off-beats) and tension (dissonance) to illustrate "waves" (as in ocean waves - it's predictable and it's unpredictable, you've got to time it).

- The descent + the arpeggio at 2:07-2:16 is inspired by [まふまふ's cover](https://youtu.be/t-wPaLrL2yA).

- Fireworks have different types. The ones that pop nicely, the ones that fizz after a delay. The chrysanthemums, the comets, the falling leaves. The second chorus + bridge (2:18-3:01) attempts to paint these illuminations in the night sky.

- A big glissando at 3:50 to mark the beginning of the finale, _that one_ firework.

- Two "easter eggs" references with the same "colors" as this song

 - 3:20-3:50 is [夏祭り/Natsumatsuri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6u-igSU43Y). Everyone's go-to Taiko-no-Tatsujin song, classic nostalgic summer pop, and an homage to my piano teacher from long time ago - I vaguely remember her saying that was the first song she remembers wanting to cover. Um, sorry for being a bad student back then.

 - 4:44 is [君がくれた夏](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qhJ1vhTH7A) by 家入レオ. Need I say more?
