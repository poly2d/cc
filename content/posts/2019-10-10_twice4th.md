#### Notes

I stuck to the A-side tracks for this medley.
I just used the songs that came to my mind, but if I were to retroactively state a reason for each:

- FANCY because it was one of the most recent songs.
- WiL? and DTNA because I have very fond memories of this era (my first Twice concert attendance).
- Like OOH-AHH because it's where the [_story began_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_Begins).
- Heart Shaker because it's my Twice buddy's favorite song.

Thanks to the ONCE that checked it out via [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/dkfp42/me_playing_a_twice_piano_medley_in_honor_of_4th/).
There was a comment about whether there are sheets for the arrangement.
It made me consider transcribing (maybe for a full ver of FANCY since I had some more ideas).
This was sorta rushed though - only spent a weekend and I _had_ to post it before the end of Oct 20th in Korea time ðŸ˜….
I'd want to polish it up more before writing any sheets.

Getting this out meant a lot to me.
I often feel down but Twice's music help me get through.
The music and energy is just pure positivity.
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say: I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.
Sorry for the sub-par cover - it doesn't do you justice.
I'll be better next time ðŸ™‚

#### Misc

The mini banner I placed on the piano was obtained at TwiceLights LA 190717.
