#### Notes

First YouTube upload! The previous Periscopes were captured entirely on phone, but this was the first attempt at using an audio interface in search for better sound quality.

I mixed in elements from a few inspirations. [Flowering Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb7X5F0hSGA) from the Touhou series was used at 1:34 (a nod to Niconico covers) and a variation based on [Lindsey Stirling's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wEAeNcA_A) at 1:47.

The "guitar riff" part of the song was skipped in favor of a more gentle bridge and reprise. I think it came out all right, but also feel a tinge of regret; in some of the covers I see online, the performer replace that segment with improv, original content, or just super-enthusiastic playing. It's a prime stage for the the performer to showcase their personality. So I'd like to revisit this song someday and settle my FOMO on that.
