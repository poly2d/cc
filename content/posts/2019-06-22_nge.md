This was the first piano post I shared on Twitter!
The hype in this day and age was how [Neon Genesis Evangelion was coming to Netflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/a0qq4p/evangelion_series_coming_to_netflix/) (at least for a subset of the internet 🙂).
That led me to revisit some of the theme songs from the franchise.

#### Excerpts
- [残酷な天使のテーゼ / Cruel Angel’s Thesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-QSmNReDyI) (TV Series OP)
- (Transition) [[SPOILER WARNING] Ep 19 初号機が暴走する時のBGM / Unit-1 goes berserk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A89blUjT7z8)
- [Fly me to the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5tXnflvKQ) (TV Series ED)
- [Beautiful world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmKRgqWGrWc) (Rebuild 1.0)
- This is Love (unrelated Utada Hikaru song)
- [桜流し / Sakura Nagashi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SeiwBKuFNA) (Rebuild 3.0)

#### Notes
The songs and key adjustments were picked out ahead of time (basically keep everything in C-minor), but I tried to not stick to a specific arrangement to create a bit of an improvisation experience.

My initial foray into NGE was probably 'in reverse' compared to most fans.
Circa 2010 I was fascinated with [Utada Hikaru](http://www.utadahikaru.jp/index.html)'s music.
At some point I discovered `Beautiful World`, which led me to watching the [`Rebuild`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion) series.
That led me to the [`Original`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) TV series.

I didn't think too much about inclusion of the TV series OP/ED, but I tried a twist in the latter half by including `This is Love`.
The song is actually unrelated to NGE (other than it's also by Utada), but I felt it fits in well in terms of lyrics. I wanted to contrast the last three songs which all sing of `love`, but in _very_ different lights.

- Beautiful World - natural, maternal (?)
- This is Love - lustful, self-love
- Sakura Nagashi - reminiscent, succumbing to fate

Listening to the replay, I felt I should have played the melodies louder.
I didn't notice it as I played - maybe it was the placement of the phone.
Performance wise, there were **many** mis-touches but it felt great getting the first post under my belt.

Next time I try a NGE cover I'd like to try one of the soundtracks, like [Rei-Opus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXkDRzf74yY).

#### Misc

The keyboard has a key shift feature which I was playing around with.
And of course, I forgot to re-set it before starting the broadcast.
So the pitch is shifted up +1 full step.
However, I think that lands in the original key for `Beautiful World` so maybe it's not so bad? 🤷‍♂️
