This cover is based on the scores by [Cosmo Pianist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djTviWYP-xo). In general this was a good etude for dynamics and dissonant chords. I didn't hold back when it came to expression - overlaying my emotions along with the somber world view that is 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'.

I tapped into some of the _heavy_ scenes from the work for inspiration; think - drowning, choking. Yeah that's pretty fucked up imagery to draw on, but _he_ just wouldn't shut the fuck up. I had to end it.

The title itself is also too relatable. As my man [Adler](https://stoicanswers.com/2019/05/12/separation-of-tasks/) would've said, `all problems are just interpersonal-relationship problems`.

Another source of inspiration was actually [I Want You (She's so heavy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAe2Q_LhY8g) by The Beatles. Interpretations may vary here (fwiw - also like to analyze the Abbey Road album as one unit), but the I see interleaving exchanges between these dual personas inside the storyteller: one that's somewhat casual or collected ("I want you~ ...") vs the one that's undergoing an absolute nuclear meltdown (4:25-End), perhaps a voice that's been suppressed for a bit too long.

Tried to channel this kind of polarity as well in my cover. I thought it came through well in the segment starting at 1:40, with the left hand (inner persona) really having its own voice rather than being just an accompaniment.
