The soundtrack of the [Guilty Crown](https://guiltycrown.fandom.com/wiki/Guilty_Crown) series was what led me to find [Animenz](https://www.youtube.com/user/Animenzzz) on youtube in early 2012.

I found his cover of `ÃŸios`.

I had some lessons during my childhood, but by this time I had absolutely forgotten how to play piano.
But when I saw his video for the first time, I couldn't help but try it.
There was _no way_ I was not going to at least _attempt_ it - the `adrenaline` was still lingering from just having watched a epic GC episode.

So I printed the sheets.

I couldn't play it, of course. But it got me to pick up piano again, and _I am so glad that I did_.

Due to school, my relationship with piano was a cycle of extended on-and-offs, but I eventually picked up this song again. I still can't play it end-to-end properly (I find the left hand jumps starting measure 78 especially challenging), but I guess I can say I made some progress.

I recall reading somewhere that `Bios` means `life` in German (can't find source)?? Well, it literally brought me back to piano-life here.


#### Misc

The majority of the original song is sung in German ([lyrics](http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/guiltycrown/guilbios.htm)).
But according to Animenz who is fluent in German, the pronunciation is not so great.
Not that I can tell though ðŸ˜….
