If [Feljin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/27490581) or [Ryu](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/30665357) were to play the piano, what would they play, and what story would they tell?

That was my thought process going into this project. This piece is inspired by [Awaiting Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtCR5rA-GsU) by Kevin MacLeod, the background music our DM used at one point for the "BRB" screen (for IRL short rests) in the Phandelver campaign.

That piece itself is a derivative of the middle section of Jupiter, one of the movements from "The Planets" orchestral suite by Gustav Holst. Also used in hymns (sometimes referred to as Thaxted), this is a tune familiar to many.

A part of me was frightened to inject my own thought process into this wonderful, well known melody - but it was the perfect song for the story _we_ wanted to tell. I mentally segmented the cover into three verses, each corresponding to the journeys of me (pre-DnD), Feijin, and Ryu. The transitions in between the verses borrow elements from [Hirahara Ayaka's J-Pop rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGWzRUdn0so) of this song.

Some more fun facts:

- The "easter egg" in this cover are the broken chords from [Ê°úÊµÅ„Åó (Sakura Nagashi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SeiwBKuFNA) from NGE Rebuild 3.0 by Utada Hikaru, used at the outset of the Feljin part ~1:30 and reprised at 2:12. Why this song? Because ["everybody finds love in the end"](https://www.jpopasia.com/hikaruutada/lyrics/321660/fant%C3%B4me/sakura-nagashi-%E6%A1%9C%E6%B5%81%E3%81%97/).

- The keys were adjusted to match the parallel keys of [Bios](/posts/2020-04-23_bios/) and [Eonian](/posts/2020-12-25_eonian/), the former of which I uploaded around the time I started DnD, and the latter of which I worked on after I decided to sit out.

- The climax from 3:30 includes some Animenz inspired elements. 3:32~3:50 pays homage to the finale from [Ëôπ„ÅÆÂàóËªä (Niji no Ressha)](/posts/2020-06-29_akb0048), where the left hand takes ownership of the melody and the base note, while the right hand fills in with blistering scales. (I attempted a similar setup in my cover of [Êâì‰∏äËä±ÁÅ´ (Uchiage Hanabi)](/posts/2020-08-31_daoko) as well, but couldn't quite nail it). 3:50~4:06 draws inspiration from the "sound wall" in the second chorus of Eonian, using similar broken chords but with triplets.

- Ryu's verse was put together with an "title screen / end credits" style in mind. 3:50~end is inspired by the final battle from the Saltmarsh campaign against the ancient bronze dragon (a.k.a.  "Middle Pete"), in which our heroes fought valiantly, equipped with our legendary weapons... but ultimately having to resort to the forbidden "bag-of-holding hack" to get it done üòÇ. The resolution tries to capture the _emptiness_ in the aftermath of the all-banishing, interplanar vortex.
