_Based on the Animenz arrangement:_ [_Video_](https://youtu.be/\_8UZMD3A2rs)_, [Sheets](https://sheet.host/sheet/vkrmZF)._

Another piece from Animenz's Guilty Crown suite of covers, also from his earlier days. It's in the same starting key as [Bios](/posts/2020-04-23_bios) but at a slower pace, 3/4 signature, and a lot more room for expressiveness.

The middle section is the most interesting to play, requiring fast right hand runs in the upper registers, mixed in with occasional slowdown/speedups as an artifact of "squeezing in" few more notes into the measure. Working out the fingering in this section was also a bit of a challenge as I had learned parts of this song before, and had to "unlearn" some of my bad habits.

It could just be a projection of myself into the song, but I feel the climax and the buildup into it is so nicely written by Animenz. Obviously the cover deviates a lot from the original starting at the middle section, but in the climax portion, I can almost see this catharsis of emotion that Inori (the character who sings the song in the actual anime) must have been suppressing the entire time and finally revealing. I tried to channel that same kind of purging in my rendition.
