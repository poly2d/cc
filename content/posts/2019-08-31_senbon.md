This live of [Senbonzakura](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/%E5%8D%83%E6%9C%AC%E6%A1%9C_(Senbonzakura)) was for a special occasion: 13th anniversary of [Hatsune Miku](https://ec.crypton.co.jp/pages/prod/vocaloid/)!
I have fond memories of this song because my roommates and I played it a lot in [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zOLSHCO4FY).

I borrowed some small nuances and snippets from two of my favorite covers of this song (listed below) - can you spot them?

- Lindsey Stirling's [violin cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wEAeNcA_A)
- Animenz's piano performance from his [2017 Shanghai concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QL4EnxyQzE)

Some say one reason for its rise to popularity was for the positive vibe it brought post-3.11.

While the theme and imagery of some [MVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqps4anhz0Q) out there may feel a bit "imperial". I'm not too fond of that element.
However, at least in how I interpret of the lyrics, I feel the song has this underlying sense of: pride & longing for a `long-lost utopia` and a `glimpse of hope` (not completely sure what this means myself üòÖ - I struggle to find the best words).
Anyways, I tried to channel that spirit towards the later half of the cover.

I want to go for a more pop vibe (maybe like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEHT04LAqA)!?) when I try it again... for the 14th anniv.
