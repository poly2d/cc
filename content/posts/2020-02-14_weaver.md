This was a 'high reach' piece for me in terms of difficulty. But it's a special song and a cover had to be done.

The most difficult segments of the song are the chorus which feature fast left-hand jumps. Many retakes were done due to a lack of accuracy here.

While less obvious, "first verse" at 0:39 (measures 25-32) was also quite challenging. Here, the left hand is responsible for both the melody and chord roots; the right hand plays an accompanying melody in the higher register. Despite a slight simplification of the RH from the transcription, controlling the volume per-hand was a struggle; the right unfortunately came out louder than I intended.

I changed some chords be more dissonant (in the intro and the reprises in between the verses) as a personal touch and to match my version of the song's story. Reading along the lyrics is one thing; interpreting them through your own lens and injecting yourself into it is a whole another beast I've yet to develop proficiency in.
