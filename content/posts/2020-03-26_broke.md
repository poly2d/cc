Every time I reread your words, I increasingly realize that you're on a different, much higher _stratum_ than the one I am on.

They say you can't buy love, but I'm beginning to think that maybe love is a bit like money?

You won't spend it on others if you don't have enough yourself, right?

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm broke as fuck.
