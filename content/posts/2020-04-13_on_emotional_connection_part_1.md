I'm not quite sure where to start for what I said in the previous post, but I figure I at the end of the day I want to understand what love is, so why not use the MW definitons of [love](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love) as an entry point? Not like I'm going to understand in one day, but a north star would be helpful because I'm sure I'll get lost along the way.

A common denominator that I see across the several is the concepts of attraction, affection, and connection. For this post I'll see if I can make sense of those terms and a few related ones, solely based on MW. Fingers crossed for not too many circular definitions.

<br/>

[Affection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affection) feels like the easiest to grasp.

> [affection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affection) | 1 : a feeling of liking and caring for someone or something : tender attachment : fondness

I think I know what that feels like? I wasn't really sure how to describe _attachment_ though.

> [attached](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attached) | 2 : **emotionally connected** : having strong feelings of affection or connection

WOW, there's the e-word AND the c-word. I'll save them for later, but see where I'm going with this?  

A bit of an aside - I think it's noteworthy that these show up in the MW definition of [friend](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/friend).

> [friend](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/friend) | 1a : one **attached** to another by **affection** or esteem

<br/>


Up next is [attraction](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attraction).

> [attraction](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attraction) | 1a : the act, process, or power of attracting

> [attract](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attract) | b : to draw by appeal to natural or excited interest, emotion, or aesthetic sense


And just to hone in on specific words within the definition:

> [interest](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interest) | 1a : a feeling that accompanies or causes special attention to something or someone

> [emotion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emotion) | 1a : a conscious mental reaction (such as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong feeling usually directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body

> b : a state of feeling

It seems clear that _interest_ is a feelings that have a specific target. For the individual experiencing those feelings, the target could be described as _attractive_, or having properties that the individual finds attractive. Then I guess the term _attraction_ describes this (for now, unidirectional) process.

I'm not sure what I was looking for with _emotion_ - I feel 1a seems to lean towards negative reactions, but I think emotions could encompass positive reactions too (e.g extreme joy). Reactions are caused by external forces, so I tend to agree with 1a suggesting that there is a target that the feeling is projected onto. I might be overgeneralizing or mixing up cause-and-effect here, but I think it's fair to say positive emotions have an attractive targets associated with them. On the contrary, the negative emotions could be hand-in-hand with unattractive targets.

<br/>


I feel the most abstract is [connection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connection). I picked out the one that feels the most applicable (with strikethrough applied on what I felt was irrelevant for this soliloquy).

> [connection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connection) | 3 : a person connected with another especially by ~~marriage, kinship, or~~ common interest

> [connect](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connect) | 4 : to have or establish a rapport

> [rapport](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapport) | : a friendly, harmonious relationship especially : a relationship characterized by agreement, mutual understanding, or empathy that makes communication possible or easy


_(* I don't feel like going down what is likely a rabbit hole of [social](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/social) [connected](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connected)-ness, so I'll leave that out for now.)_

I guess common _interest_ means these individuals experience _attraction_ towards a common target (this could be, for example, specific genres of music). _Rapport_ is described by common understanding and empathy. For a connection based on common interest, I'm inclined to say that's facilitated by the shared experience in being subject to attraction to the common target (the shared interest).

I used interest on my first pass since it's in the definition, but I figure the _basis_ for the connection could be anything as long as it helps establish rapport - such as shared experiences or distastes.

It's getting long, so I'll stop here for now and continue in the following post.
