Today I re-listened to the Radwimps song from _Weathering with You_.

The lyrics hurt more than ever.

<br/>


This is the courage that _you_ gave me

So I want to use it for _you_

This is the love that _you_ helped me grow

So it won't mean anything if it's not with _you_

Is there anything that love can still do?

_Is there anything that I can still do?_
