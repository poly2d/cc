Today I re-listened to the Radwimps song from _Weathering with You_.

The lyrics hurt more than ever.

<br/>


> This is the courage that **you** gave me

> So I want to use it for **you**

> This is the love that **you** helped me grow

> So it won't mean anything if it's not with **you**

> Is there anything that love can still do?

> **Is there anything that I can still do?**
