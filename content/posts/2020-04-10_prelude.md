In hindsight, I've been throwing out words like "romantic love" and "emotional connection" without a clear understanding of them.
As in, I currently don't have the ability to _clearly_ and _concisely_ explain to someone what those words mean to me.

Conflicts and frustration could grow from misunderstandings.
Misunderstandings could root from difference in beliefs or definitions on the ideas being discussed (or from a lack of them).

In a series of soon-to-come posts, I will attempt to attach _personal definitions_ to some of these concepts, with the help of existing resources and past discussions (hello merriam webster, hello internet, hello world).

Any foundation more rigorous then obscure constructs trapped inside my mind will enable _productive discussions_ around these topics.

Note that I said **personal** definitions, meaning they are my takes and can be different from yours or other's.
And they'll likely change over time too as I find new perspectives.
