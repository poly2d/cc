Continuing the ludicrous exploration which set off my previous post, I'd like to revisit the term _attached_. The definition is reproduced below:

> [attached](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attached) | 2 : **emotionally connected** : having strong feelings of affection or connection

There's an implication of a _connection_ with _emotion_ as the basis. What exactly does this mean? Maybe different things depending on the context and the individuals involved?

Before moving forwards, I'll also reproduce below a previous snippet of my take on _emotion_ and it's relation to _attraction_:

> I'm not sure what I was looking for with _emotion_ - I feel 1a seems to lean towards negative reactions, but I think emotions could encompass positive reactions too (e.g extreme joy). Reactions are caused by external forces, so I tend to agree with 1a suggesting that there is a target that the feeling is projected onto. I might be overgeneralizing or mixing up cause-and-effect here, but I think it's fair to say positive emotions have an attractive targets associated with them. On the contrary, the negative emotions could be hand-in-hand with unattractive targets.

<br/>

[Connected](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connect) means [rapport](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapport) was established with _emotions_ as the basis.

What is it about the _emotions_ that helped build a "relationship characterized by agreement, mutual understanding, or empathy that makes communication possible or easy"?

If we follow the aforementioned personal concept of emotions being hand-in-hand with attraction, maybe it could mean:

- Having a common experience of similar emotions in _separate_ pasts. In this case, the targets could have been different but similar.
- Having a common experience of similar emotions in _shared_ pasts. In this case, the targets could have been identical.

Emotions are one's reactions to the external circumstances or activities that shape their world. Having similar upbringings under strict parents, suffering together in the same classrooms, or experiencing a wonderful concert together, might be examples of this.

Under this path of thought though, it seems like emotional connection could be simply a result of shared history in which both individuals experienced similar emotions; there's parity between the individuals' objective _and_ subjective truths (the past).

Even if we disregard my personal concept and remove the idea of attraction from all this, I think it still makes sense. The basis could be that the individuals share the tendencies / ability to feel the same type of emotions in the world that we live in.

What I mean by _the world_ is the _physical / objective reality_. There's also the _subjective realities_ within us that we form by accumulating over time perceptions and interpretations of the physical reality. I guess our emotions are not reactions to what occurs to us in the objective world, but rather reactions to our subjective world, our _interpretations_ of the objective reality. Perhaps emotional connected-ness is simply a measure of how similar two individuals' "lenses" are at a given point in life.

<br/>

I think that somewhat does it for the connectedness. Where does the affection come from though? An emotional connection without affection seems a bit cold? I associate emotional connectedness with love. So how does mutual understanding and rapport lead to affection: _a feeling of liking and caring for someone?_

Perhaps it occurs in the case in which the target of the individual A's emotion is individual B? This _attraction_ could be uni- or bi- directional. How does attraction lead to affection? That's something I'll try to explore next.
