As usual, the first thing that crosses my mind when I wake up is _your name_.

_Is that disgusting?_

What's unusual is that I've been waking up way before the time I set on my alarm clock.

What's unusual is that I just lay there for hours, trying to convince myself, _you don't really care about me._

_Isn't that disgusting?_

<br/>


As of this point, I still find the need to do this until I can get up again.

A _mourning_ routine.

<br/>


You once said things are never so black and white.

Right now I wish they were that way.

Everything would be so much easier to swallow.

<br/>


What's wrong with me. How the fuck do I fix myself.

Do you even want me to be your friend?
