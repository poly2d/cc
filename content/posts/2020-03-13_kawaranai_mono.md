#### Notes

**Video**: https://youtu.be/_xTmQi57xmk

**Sheets**: https://gakufu.poly2d.xyz/kawaranaimono.pdf

_Writing this retroactively. The cover was posted on Mar 13. Sheets were completed in May afterwards._

My first piano arrangement, and a special song for a special occasion. This initial intent was to present sheets to accompany the video in March. But I ended up abandoning it - the more I tried to work on it, the more I found the idea "limiting". Some parts of the arrangement were obviously thought out more than others, but at the end of the day I wanted this to "flow out" freely.

The sheets were put together retroactively based on what I played in the video; I took the liberty of touching up on a few notes and segments. While is not too difficult, the performance for me was about `storytelling` and injecting myself and my emotions into the piece.

In terms of techniques, the arrangement features several left-right crossovers (Measures 68-75, 114-121) and prominent left-hand melodies / countermelodies (122-137, 138-143, 159-164) which may require some time to get used to.

The highlight of this piece is the section starting at measure 102, featuring `かたわれ時` (Kataware Doki), a song from *君の名は* that is unrelated to *時をかける少女*. But as you put it nicely, they have the really similar `colors`. The かたわれ時 segment builds the stage for the mashup section starting at 122, captioned `タイムリープ`, which serves as the vehicle for my personal expression. Developing this into form was especially fulfilling, and in future arrangements or compositions I'd like to explore this technique further.

#### P.S.

Following sheet music is great, but it is also just a reference - if you're feeling it, I encourage you to "tear it apart" and make it your own.
