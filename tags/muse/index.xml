      <description>Continuing the ludicrous exploration which set off my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit the term attached. The definition is reproduced below:
 attached | 2 : emotionally connected : having strong feelings of affection or connection
 There&amp;rsquo;s an implication of a connection with emotion as the basis. What exactly does this mean? Maybe different things depending on the context and the individuals involved?
Before moving forwards, I&amp;rsquo;ll also reproduce below a previous snippet of my take on emotion and it&amp;rsquo;s relation to attraction:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure where to start for what I said in the previous post, but I figure I at the end of the day I want to understand what love is, so why not use the MW definitons of love as an entry point? Not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to understand in one day, but a north star would be helpful because I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get lost along the way.</description>

      <description>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
&amp;ndash; Henry David Thoreau, Walden
 
In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;ve been throwing out words like &amp;ldquo;romantic love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;emotional connection&amp;rdquo; without a clear understanding of them. As in, I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to clearly and concisely explain to someone what those words mean to me.</description>

      <description>Being polite is good, but being active is as important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t say anything, the things you want won&amp;rsquo;t appear right before you.
&amp;ndash; a wise friend
 Those were the words of my wise friend, who wrote to me years ago. You may remember that I shared them with you too. To this day, I still find myself scared to embrace those words. But there are also times when painfully I realize what he meant.</description>
