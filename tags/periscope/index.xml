(~2:00) Like OOH-AHH (~3:28) Dance the Night Away (~4:57) Heart Shaker - outro (~6:45)  Notes I stuck to the A-side tracks for this medley. I just used the songs that came to my mind, but if I were to retroactively state a reason for each:</description>

      <description>🎹 Guilty Crown - βios ギルティクラウン OST #Piano #Music https://t.co/mhtr6ELk5O
&amp;mdash; Ryu (@poly2d) October 14, 2019  Notes Based on the Animenz arrangement
 Video: https://youtu.be/DcjUOdeq6G8 Sheet: https://sheet.host/sheet/1uMLWW Original: https://youtu.be/UMCka_vXtL4  The soundtrack of the Guilty Crown series was what led me to find Animenz on youtube in early 2012.
I found his cover of ßios.
I had some lessons during my childhood, but by this time I had absolutely forgotten how to play piano.</description>

      <description>🎹 千本桜 / Senbonzakura live piano #初音ミク生誕祭2019 #HatsuneMikuBirthday https://t.co/HNJVg866Mn
&amp;mdash; Ryu (@poly2d) September 1, 2019  Notes  Original: https://youtu.be/P6C3szts5C4  This live of Senbonzakura was for a special occasion: 13th anniversary of Hatsune Miku! I have fond memories of this song because my roommates and I played it a lot in Taiko no Tatsujin.
I borrowed some small nuances and snippets from two of my favorite covers of this song (listed below) - can you spot them?</description>

      <description>This was the first piano post I shared on Twitter! The hype in this day and age was how Neon Genesis Evangelion was coming to Netflix (at least for a subset of the internet 🙂). That led me to revisit some of the theme songs from the franchise.
