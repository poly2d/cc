      <description>Continuing the ludicrous exploration which set off my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit the term attached. The definition is reproduced below:
 attached | 2 : emotionally connected : having strong feelings of affection or connection
 There&amp;rsquo;s an implication of a connection with emotion as the basis. What exactly does this mean? Maybe different things depending on the context and the individuals involved?
Before moving forwards, I&amp;rsquo;ll also reproduce below a previous snippet of my take on emotion and it&amp;rsquo;s relation to attraction:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure where to start for what I said in the previous post, but I figure I at the end of the day I want to understand what love is, so why not use the MW definitons of love as an entry point? Not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to understand in one day, but a north star would be helpful because I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get lost along the way.</description>

      <description>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
&amp;ndash; Henry David Thoreau, Walden
 
In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;ve been throwing out words like &amp;ldquo;romantic love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;emotional connection&amp;rdquo; without a clear understanding of them. As in, I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to clearly and concisely explain to someone what those words mean to me.</description>

      <description>Being polite is good, but being active is as important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t say anything, the things you want won&amp;rsquo;t appear right before you.
&amp;ndash; a wise friend
 Those were the words of my wise friend, who wrote to me years ago. You may remember that I shared them with you too. To this day, I still find myself scared to embrace those words. But there are also times when painfully I realize what he meant.</description>

      <description>If my message didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense - that was my nice way of saying, &amp;ldquo;fuck off because you&amp;rsquo;re not helping me right now.&amp;rdquo; I let the first one go but the second just felt disrespectful.
Maybe you are not so great at 空気を読むこと, as you hinted at before. And as good as it sounds, I don&amp;rsquo;t think &amp;ldquo;treat others the way you want to be treated&amp;rdquo; needs to apply to every situation.</description>

      <description>I thought you understood, so I was a bit surprised to see you break the silence. That&amp;rsquo;s cheating.

I see your perspective though. Thoughts have an expiration date.
(And feelings have expirations too apparently&amp;hellip; as I learned the hard way. fml.)

Thanks for sharing.
My initial response was - wtf why are you doing this to me?
Stop making me even more sad, lmao.
I do like the chords and the voice.</description>

      <description>As usual, the first thing that crosses my mind when I wake up is your name.
Is that disgusting?
What&amp;rsquo;s unusual is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been waking up way before the time I set on my alarm clock.
What&amp;rsquo;s unusual is that I just lay there for hours, trying to convince myself, you don&amp;rsquo;t really care about me.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t that disgusting?

As of this point, I still find the need to do this until I can get up again.</description>

      <description>Today I re-listened to the Radwimps song from Weathering with You.
The lyrics hurt more than ever.

 This is the courage that you gave me
So I want to use it for you
This is the love that you helped me grow
So it won&amp;rsquo;t mean anything if it&amp;rsquo;s not with you
Is there anything that love can still do?
Is there anything that I can still do?</description>

      <description>I can see where you are coming from. But there are some things I fail to understand completely.
If I had a partner, I&amp;rsquo;d want them to fulfill as much of my wants as possible. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;d do anything I can (within reason I guess) to help fulfill my partner&amp;rsquo;s wants? Like even if you know you can&amp;rsquo;t do so immediately, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you still want to and eventually try to reach a level that you can?</description>

      <description>Every time I reread your words, I increasingly realize that you&amp;rsquo;re on a different, much higher stratum than the one I am on.
They say you can&amp;rsquo;t buy love, but I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to think that maybe love is a bit like money?
You won&amp;rsquo;t spend it on others if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough yourself, right?

I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that I&amp;rsquo;m broke as fuck.</description>

      <description>Did my life lose all meaning?
Everything hurts.

Did life even have meaning before this?
Was I just trying to put meaning into it?
Is that wrong?</description>

      <description>Notes Based on the Animenz arrangement
 Video: https://youtu.be/P6C3szts5C4 Sheet: https://sheet.host/sheet/IGm7F5  This was a &amp;lsquo;high reach&amp;rsquo; piece for me in terms of difficulty. But it&amp;rsquo;s a special song and a cover had to be done.
The most difficult segments of the song are the chorus which feature fast left-hand jumps. Many retakes were done due to a lack of accuracy here.
While less obvious, &amp;ldquo;first verse&amp;rdquo; at 0:39 (measures 25-32) was also quite challenging.</description>

      <description>Notes First YouTube upload! The previous Periscopes were captured entirely on phone, but this was the first attempt at using an audio interface in search for better sound quality.
I mixed in elements from a few inspirations. Flowering Night from the Touhou series was used at 1:34 (a nod to Niconico covers) and a variation based on Lindsey Stirling&amp;rsquo;s cover at 1:47.
The &amp;ldquo;guitar riff&amp;rdquo; part of the song was skipped in favor of a more gentle bridge and reprise.</description>

      <description>🎹 Guilty Crown - βios ギルティクラウン OST #Piano #Music https://t.co/mhtr6ELk5O
&amp;mdash; Ryu (@poly2d) October 14, 2019  Notes Based on the Animenz arrangement
 Video: https://youtu.be/DcjUOdeq6G8 Sheet: https://sheet.host/sheet/1uMLWW Original: https://youtu.be/UMCka_vXtL4  The soundtrack of the Guilty Crown series was what led me to find Animenz on youtube in early 2012.
I found his cover of ßios.
I had some lessons during my childhood, but by this time I had absolutely forgotten how to play piano.</description>

&amp;mdash; Ryu (@poly2d) September 1, 2019  Notes  Original: https://youtu.be/P6C3szts5C4  This live of Senbonzakura was for a special occasion: 13th anniversary of Hatsune Miku! I have fond memories of this song because my roommates and I played it a lot in Taiko no Tatsujin.
I borrowed some small nuances and snippets from two of my favorite covers of this song (listed below) - can you spot them?</description>

      <description>This was the first piano post I shared on Twitter! The hype in this day and age was how Neon Genesis Evangelion was coming to Netflix (at least for a subset of the internet 🙂). That led me to revisit some of the theme songs from the franchise.
